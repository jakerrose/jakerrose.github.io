My portfolio website has evolved through my courses at The Tech Academy. I started with HTML and CSS to create a one page website with a slideshow and video background. I used CSS to animate the appearance of the nav bar and contact form. With Javascript, I was able to create the working contact button to open the form to submit name, email and message. I also used JavaScript to create the functional buttons for the slideshow. I now have a portfolio page with an image representing each project as well as Bootstrap buttons. The images link to individual views with a slideshow for each project as well as more details.
